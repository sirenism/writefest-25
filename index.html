I may never see Mr. Loreto again, but for as long as I go on any stage, I will always do breathing exercises like he taught me to.",

Especially not during the schoolwide debates, her face flushed red and her chest heaving back into her ribs as she scoured for her words. The other team stared at her like she was about to pass out, but she didn’t. She never did. But the inhaler was always there, clicking against her wallet, louder than the applause.",

Strong—menthol, eucalyptus, camphor—the kind of sharp that clears your sinuses in the most forceful way possible. It clings to her clothes, her hair, everything she touches. The whole room starts smelling like a pharmacy if you sit with her long enough.",

How many years had it been since he’d seen the thing? Experimentally, he flexed his fingers, cringing when he saw his bones jutting from beneath his skin. Quickly, he put his hand away. The sight of it almost revulsed him.",
            "Next, he saw Hugo napping in the bed next to his. Immediately, he had the urge to wake him up. His big brother, for sure, would know what was going on, would know how to fix this. He reached out to shake him awake. Immediately, however, he drew back as if burned, repulsed again by the sight of his hand. The security of blindness was gone. Now, confronted with the proof of his own body, he felt almost sick.",
            "“Hugo.” His voice was clear, lacking the waver he’d thought it would have. Somehow, a part of him had thought his voice would be visible somehow, like soft blue waves emanating through the air. Given his current predicament, however, he spared no time to think about that. “Hugo, wake up. Come on. I–I can see!”",
            "Finally verbalizing the thought made him seize up. See. He’d had to grasp for that word, seeing as it hadn’t been taught in schools for ages out of a lack of necessity. For a moment, he wondered how he’d gotten to learn it in the first place. Maybe from one of those vintage books he liked listening to…<br><br>It was meandering thoughts like those that distracted him as Hugo’s eyes snapped open.",
            "“Don’t.” Hugo sat up, clamping his hand over Jordie’s mouth. His eyes were wild with fear and anger. “Shut up, Jordie. You have no idea what you’re talking about. I need you to never, ever say something like that again. You can’t see. No one can see. Got it?”<br><br>Their eyes met, his hand still clamped over Jordie’s mouth, and all at once, he understood.<br><br>Mutely, he nodded.",
            "Hugo sighed in relief, finally letting up. “Good,” he mumbled, brushing his hands off on his pants. Jordie wanted—no, needed—to ask him around a million different questions. His voice didn’t seem to want to cooperate with him, however. Almost as if he’d traded one ability for another.<br><br>After a while, he managed something. “You too?” His voice was small.",
            "His voice was tight as he responded, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”<br><br>Hugo’s eyes had lost their hardness, however. His chest still heaved from the exertion of his outburst, and as he looked at Jordie, he just seemed terrified. “God, why you?” he whispered, more to himself. “Why you, of all people?”",
            "Jordie tilted his head. He couldn’t pretend to understand what he was saying, but he had a feeling it meant something. Before he could ask, however, his brother was speaking again. “You can’t tell Mom or Dad, either. Not a single one of your friends. I don’t care that you trust them. Not a soul other than me, okay? You don’t understand what they’ll do to you.”",
            "“Who’s they?” The questions flooded out of him. “What do you mean, why me? And why are you being so weird about this? I don’t get it. It’s not that big of a deal, right? We can just get it fixed somewhere. Let’s just ask, like, a V-9 repairman. C’mon, Hugo…”",
            "“They won’t fix it for us.” He scoffed. “Do you know what they do to problems?”<br><br>“Solve them?”<br><br>“Eliminate them. God, Jordie.” He rubbed his eyes hard. “I forget you’re 16 sometimes.”",
            "They sat in silence for a long time. It was strange, this tension that lay thick between them. Jordie had never heard his brother seem so urgent before, so fearful. It was so, so wrong. Still, he kept quiet, not wanting to make things any worse. He had enough to ponder about, anyway.",
            "“Who’s they?” he asked again, finding that one thing was still unanswered.<br><br>“If I knew, they’d be gone by now.” He smiled bitterly. “Look, there’s really not much to see here, okay? Not in our house, anyway.” He coughed into his fist, masking a grimace. “Outside… That’s a different story. You can’t, um, go outside. Not for now, anyway. Let’s give it a week.”<br><br>“But I have school!”",
            "The bark of laughter that came out of Hugo startled him. “Oh, school. Really? As if that does anything for you.” At the silence that met his words, he sighed. The sigh he only sighed when he felt aggrieved by his little brother’s naïveté. The sigh that made Jordie immediately relax. The sigh that let him know that everything would be taken care of, at least by him. “I’ll forge your doctor’s certificate. Just don’t be a wuss and rat me out.”",
            "He grinned. “Okay!” That, he could do.<br><br>Hugo glared at him, clearly trying to muster his anger. However, the only thing that he seemed to be was sad. So, so sad. “The first thing I need to teach you…” Reaching forward, he passed his hand over Jordie’s eyes, cloaking his world in darkness once more. Deprived of his sight, he found that he sorely missed it. “...is how to see without seeing.”",
            "That made about zero sense. He sighed, rushing to elaborate.<br><br>“What I mean is—ah, it’s hard to explain. Just watch me.”",
            "Hugo stood up and wandered around their room. But there was a different quality to the way he explored, something he couldn’t quite pinpoint. His eyes had glazed over, focused somewhere to the right of him, focused on nothing at all. But as he gripped the wall, following the various shelves to navigate, he finally realized what it was.<br><br>“Oh. Oh!” He perked up. “I get it!”",
            "“Yeah?” He turned back to Jordie, meeting his eyes again with a proud little smile. “Okay, I wanna see you try. And I’m not letting you outside until you can do this like a natural. Remember, neither of us can see, okay?”",
            "They made a game of it. The rest of the day was spent stumbling over furniture and giggling at each other, practicing the “blindness” that they’d once had. It really shouldn’t have been as fun as it was. But as with most forbidden things, the danger only made it sweeter. They tripped, they crashed into walls, they whispered warnings and dared each other to cheat with quick, guilty glances.",
            "And if, later that night, Hugo prayed and cried and pleaded under the moon for the first time in years—well, no one had to see that but him.",
